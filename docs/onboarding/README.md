# Onboarding to DARIA

These are the steps to onboard your fund to the DCAF-managed DARIA pipeline.

* Reach out to the DARIA team by email, slack, etc.

* Someone from the DARIA team (probably @nerdygirl537) will hop on a call with your team to demonstrate DARIA's features and workflow, and to talk through your process to see if this is a good fit for you.
  * The person from the DARIA team reports back to talk about about engineering changes we might need, if applicable.

* The DARIA team will share this documentation on how DARIA works. You should use [our training environment](https://sandbox.dcabortionfund.org) for this.
  * To try out the case manager workflow, follow the directions at: TK USER GUIDE
  * To see the more general case manager guide, covering some additional things you can do as a case manager, see: TK CASE MANAGER DOCS
  * To see the administrative tools such as data analysis and accounting, see: TK ADMIN DOCS

* If you are still interested, a rep from DARIA/DCAF will begin the paperwork process. This is an agreement signed by both sides agreeing to cost, and affirming that your data is yours and that DCAF can't access it.

* We pick a date to create your fund's instance of DARIA. (Engineering instructions for this are in the [Setting up a New Instance doc](SETTING_UP_A_NEW_INSTANCE.md)). This is usually a month before you plan on going live.

* You cut DCAF a check for your DARIA instance's server bill.

* Someone from the DARIA team helps you plan on how to migrate your data over. (The DARIA team does not do data migrations but will help you plan yours.) Our playbook for this is in the [Migrating your Data doc](MIGRATING_YOUR_DATA.md).

* On a day you decide, once your data is migrated in and your case managers are ready to go, you can start using DARIA as your system of record.
