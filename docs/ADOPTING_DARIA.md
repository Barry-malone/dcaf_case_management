# Adopting DARIA

If you are a fund considering adopting DARIA as your case management system of record, this may answer common questions about how things work. We also have a sandbox/training app where no actual patient data lives for experimenting. [FILL IN ANY NECESSARY DETAIL]

## The case management workflow

## Administration toolkit

DARIA provides a number of workflows to administer and report on your funds activities. Analysts are able to export an anonymized spreadsheet for analysis; administrators are able to keep track of which clinics your fund  are and aren't working with; and your accounting team can use a specialized workflow to mark which pledges have been cashed.

## Your DARIA instance and its data is yours

Every fund's DARIA instance is separate from others. Your DARIA instance and its data is completely yours to use. DCAF and other DARIA funds do not have access to your data.

## Costs

DARIA costs start at $84 a year ($7 a month for 12 months), paid to DCAF once a year. This covers your share of server fees, and gets your fund its own URL and database. The DARIA engineering team will automatically update your instance with patches and new features. Funds which see a heavy amount of patient traffic (2,000+ new patients per year) may need to invest in a database upgrade at an additional $216 a year after the first year.
